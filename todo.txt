- Algorithm
    - TagPositionAnalyzer
        - Calculates subtended angle between two timestamps of the tag gps to the base gps
        - Looks for timestamps where subtended angle is greater than a threshold
            - By
                - For each gps position of tag it calculates angle from the base
                - It goes through the data from timestamp 0
                - It expands a frame of timestamps until the range of angles in that frame > some threshold
                - It returns the endpoints of the range of angles for that frame
                - It starts a new frame from that timestamp
                - It repeats the process finding min and max angles in frames until it has gone through all the data

            - To handle comparing q4 - q1
                - Save the quadrant for each angle
                - If you get a q1
                    - Adjust all previous and future q4s in that frame
