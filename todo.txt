- Remove render from element_renderers init
- Rename circumcirle_analyzer object motion circumcirle_analyzer
-
- Use a class for circumcircle objects

- For circumcircle analyzer do lazy calculation and add a recacluate method.

- Base position calibration
    + Get frames with angle range greater than threshold
    - Use the timestamps for min and max angle
    - For each viewable object at those timestamps 
        - If the object was moving in the same rotation as tag
            - create circumcircles using d from tag_gps and angle from image_analyzer
        - Keep track of
            - Everytime the object was moving in the oposite rotation from the tag in the time in question
            - Everytime a circumcircle intersected with the error circle
            - The part of the curve of that circumcirle within the error circle.
    - Imagine an error circle that is radius max_gps_error with center on camera.gps_position
    - Retain only portion of each circumcircle that is within the error circle

- Eliminate sympy from geometry_utils use only shapely
