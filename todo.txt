- VerticalPhotoList
    - Add instructions at the top
    - Add a done button at the top
    - Callback with results from position_pickers


- PanMotorToFovConsistencyChecker
    - Visualize FOV
    - Choose regions with fixed FOV and large pan
    - Show an image from extremes
    - Ask the user to pick the same object in each image
    - Calculate angle
    - Compare to pan

- TagGpsTimebaseAligner
  - Show plan view with map and scrubber
    - Get extents of lat long data
    - Get map of area with extents

  - Show video with scrubber
  - Scrub to same point on map and video

- GeoMapper
    - MapFitter
        - For a set of lat long datapoints
        - Get extents of lat and long
        - Add a border

        - Test 1
            - Show 21 zoom map 640 by 640
            - Place markers at the markers
            - RESULT: markers align
        - Test 2
            - Show 20 zoom map 640 by 640
            - RESULT: markers align
        - Test 3
            - Show 20 zoom map 400 x 640
            - RESULT: markers align
        - Test 4
            - Show 19 zoom 400 x 640
            - Markers dont align
        CONCLUSION: Maps do not exactly double with zoom.
        SOLUTION: Get empirical data for zoom 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
        - Test zoom 19
        - Test zoom 18
        - Test zoom 17
        CONCLUSION - Now it works
