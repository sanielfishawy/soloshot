- Base position calibration
    - Get frames with angle range greater threshold
    - Use the timestamps for min and max angle
    - For each viewable object at those timestamps create circumcircles using d from tag_gps and angle from image_analyzer
    - Imagine an error circle that is radius max_gps_error with center on camera.gps_position
    - Retain only portion of each circumcircle that is within the error circle
    - See how it goes.
