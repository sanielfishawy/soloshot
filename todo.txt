- BaseCalibrator
    - ObjectRanker
        - Get frames from object position analzyer
        - Create a hash of objects
            - Moved opposite tag n
            - Moved opposite tag t
            - Did not intersect error circle n
            - Did not intersect error circle t
            - Eliminated t
            - Eliminated reason
                - Eliminate all moved opposite tag
                - Once one has intersected error cirlcle n times eliminate all that have intersected fewer than n-1 times
    
    - BasePositionCalculator
        - Gets error circles for most likely tag candidate
        - Provides base position

    - BaseAngleCalculatorCalculator
        - With camera gps position set to base position rerun the frames
        - Use offset of tag object to calculate angle error.
