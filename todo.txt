    - Modes
        - results file exists
            - Picks points from results file
            - Shows scrubber with pre selection for those points
        - results file doesnt exist
            x Finds local_maxima in pan motor movement
            x Shows scrubber without pre selection for those points

 - Find all pan direction changes with high rate of change
    - Times at which
        - First deriviative crosses zero
        - Second derivative is high
    - Show those on scrub and ask user to pick point at which pan direction changes
    - Get the offsets beteen frame time and pan direction change time

 - Present the two photos for the frame and pick the same point on both frames
 - Save
